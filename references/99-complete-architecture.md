# 0. Executive Architecture Summary

The target platform is not a static dashboard and not a closed scenario viewer. It is a dynamic, time-phased planning system whose primary object is the evolving state of the enterprise production flow. The system starts from a fact-anchored current state, projects future states in daily buckets, allows controlled manipulation of future decision variables, recalculates consequences through production dependencies and constrained resources, evaluates feasibility and business value, and turns an approved plan into an operational baseline that is later reconciled with actual results.

The central design rule is: Past is Fact; Future is Plan. Actual material consumption, actual progress, actual confirmations, actual costs and closed-day machine states are immutable. Future allocations and assumptions are versioned and branchable. Every future change must be represented as a typed event and must propagate through the dependency graph from commitment to product, production order, operation, resource and financial/commitment effect.

The minimum planning quantum is one planning day. Intraday events are accepted at any time, but their planning effect is applied to the next open planning day unless a specific event type is explicitly configured as an immediate same-day capacity adjustment. The standard behavior is therefore a rolling daily planning horizon.

SAP S/4HANA is treated as the operational system of record for SAP-owned master and transactional facts. The platform is a dynamic planning, impact-analysis and decision layer around those facts; it does not recreate ERP transaction processing. All write-backs to SAP are mediated through released interfaces and explicit integration contracts.

# 1. Purpose, Scope, Design Authority and Source Basis

## 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the complete target architecture and implementable engineering baseline for a MAPNA PARS-oriented dynamic production planning platform. It is intended to be used as the architecture baseline for backend, frontend, integration, data, QA, DevOps, security and operations teams.

## 1.2 Scope

- Dynamic daily planning from commitment through actual result.

- Time-phased capacity planning for machines/work centers, manpower, materials, cash and selected external constraints.

- Production-order and operation-level planning aligned with SAP manufacturing concepts.

- Daily forecast of material shortages, capacity overloads and commitment impacts.

- What-if scenario branching from a fact-anchored current plan.

- Feasibility calculation, resource injection requirement and opportunity-cost analysis.

- Multi-criterion optimization with configurable objective functions.

- Management decision, approval, plan commitment and execution follow-up.

- Actual-vs-forecast reconciliation and first-class lesson learned.

- SAP S/4HANA integration, security, audit, observability and controlled deployment.

## 1.3 Explicit non-scope

- Replacing SAP FI/MM/PP/SD/PS/PM/QM transaction processing.

- Direct access to SAP application database tables for business processing.

- Replacing MES/shop-floor machine controllers.

- Real-time sub-second machine control or safety interlocks.

- Autonomous management decisions without configured approval authority.

- Uncontrolled AI-generated writes into SAP or the planning baseline.

## 1.4 Source basis

The official MAPNA Generator website states that PARS was established in 1377/1998, initially to transfer technology and manufacture thermal generators up to 160 MW, hydro generators up to 250 MW and power-plant busducts; it also describes wind-turbine activity, industrial generators, traction motors, electric motors, electric-vehicle drive motors, after-sales services and specialized power services. The site also states exports to Syria, Iraq and Tajikistan. These statements define the domain vocabulary used in this architecture; internal operational data is not inferred from them. \[SRC-01\]\[SRC-02\]

| **SOURCE DATA QUALITY NOTE:** The official achievements page contains a numerical inconsistency: its heading states 44,000 MW while the following paragraph states 45,000 MW. The architecture does not hard-code either figure. Any executive KPI is expected to originate from governed operational data or a separately approved corporate KPI definition. \[SRC-03\] |

# 2. Business Context and Domain Boundaries

## 2.1 Publicly verified business context

| **Domain**                         | **Verified context**                                                                                  | **Architecture implication**                                                                                   |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Power generation equipment         | Hydro, thermal and wind generator products are stated on the official site.                           | Product-family model must support different BOM/routing structures and long lead-time resource profiles.       |
| Busduct                            | Power-plant busducts are explicitly stated as a product area.                                         | Discrete manufacturing flow must support non-generator product routings.                                       |
| Industrial / traction / mobility   | Industrial generators, traction motors, electric motors and electric-vehicle drive motors are stated. | Product model must not assume every product is a generator.                                                    |
| After-sales / specialized services | After-sales and specialized power services are explicitly stated.                                     | Service-order and installed-base concepts are included as configurable domain modules.                         |
| Technology transfer / engineering  | Website describes technology-transfer and improvement work.                                           | Engineering revision and controlled configuration management are first-class master data.                      |
| International business             | Exports to Syria, Iraq and Tajikistan are stated.                                                     | Delivery commitment model must support export logistics, country-specific milestones and long lead-time risks. |

## 2.2 Internal-domain assumptions required for implementation

The following are architectural assumptions rather than public claims: discrete production orders form the execution bridge; BOM and routing determine material and capacity demand; operation confirmations form the minimum execution evidence; daily planning uses time buckets of one day; resource bottlenecks can be machines, material, manpower or cash; multiple commitments may compete for the same scarce resource; and management may change priorities or inject resources. These assumptions are encoded as configurable rules so the platform can be validated against internal PARS policy during implementation.

## 2.3 Domain boundaries

| **Domain**          | **Owned by platform**                                   | **Referenced from SAP / external**                                           | **Notes**                                                  |

|--------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| P01    | Past is Fact                     | Closed planning-day actuals are immutable. Corrections use compensating events.                                           |
| P02    | Future is Plan                   | Future allocations are versioned, recalculable and branchable.                                                            |
| P03    | Daily Time Quantum               | The default planning time bucket is one calendar working day.                                                             |
| P04    | State + Event + Time             | The model is defined by temporal state and typed events, not static master-data joins.                                    |
| P05    | Every Change Has Impact          | Any material planning event must be propagated through dependencies to resources and commitments.                         |
| P06    | Scenario Is a Branch             | Scenarios fork from a current plan version and store only the delta/override events.                                      |
| P07    | Feasibility Before Preference    | Infeasible alternatives are not selectable; optimization operates only on feasible plans.                                 |
| P08    | Resource Competition Is Explicit | Shared resources and opportunity cost must be visible.                                                                    |
| P09    | SAP Is Not Rebuilt               | ERP master/transaction processing remains in SAP; the platform adds dynamic planning and decision capabilities.           |
| P10    | No Direct SAP DB Access          | Only approved released APIs/events/IDocs/RFCs through the integration boundary are permitted.                             |
| P11    | Deterministic Baseline           | Same inputs and same rule/model version must produce the same baseline plan unless stochastic mode is explicitly enabled. |
| P12    | Explainable Decisions            | Every plan and scenario must expose constraints, assumptions, affected objects and calculated impacts.                    |
| P13    | AI Is Advisory                   | AI may explain/recommend/draft but deterministic engines and approval workflows control the committed plan.               |
| P14    | On-Premise Continuity            | Core planning must operate without mandatory public-internet availability.                                                |
| P15    | Everything Versioned             | Master-data references, rules, plans, scenarios, decisions and model parameters are versioned.                            |

The repository must enforce dependency direction: domain-core cannot depend on SAP adapters, web UI cannot call repositories directly, and optimization/solver adapters depend on a solver-neutral domain contract. Database migrations are forward-only in normal release flow; destructive migrations require a separately approved migration version and rollback plan.

## 7.1 Engineering patterns

- Hexagonal architecture inside each domain module.

- Domain commands and events must not depend on controller or database classes.

- All external identifiers are stored alongside internal UUIDs.

- All mutating APIs require idempotency keys.

- Use optimistic concurrency for plan and scenario commits.

- No business logic in database triggers except invariant enforcement that cannot safely exist in application code.

- No distributed transaction across SAP and local database; use outbox/inbox and compensating actions.

# 8. Information Architecture and Temporal Model

## 8.1 Two temporal universes

PAST / FACT UNIVERSE

--------------------

Actual execution events

Actual consumption

Actual confirmations

Actual costs

Closed-day machine state

Closed-day inventory state

FUTURE / PLAN UNIVERSE

---------------------

Expected receipts

Planned operation start/end

Planned allocations

Forecast material consumption

Forecast cost/cash

Scenario assumptions

Future capacity events

## 8.2 Planning day

| **Field**         | **Definition**                                             |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| planning_day_id   | Stable internal identifier.                                |
| business_date     | Calendar date used as planning bucket.                     |
| plant_calendar_id | Working calendar governing capacity availability.          |
| status            | OPEN, FROZEN, CLOSED.                                      |
| actual_cutoff_ts  | Cut-off after which the day is treated as fact-anchored.   |
| plan_version_id   | Baseline plan active for the day.                          |
| closed_by         | User/system identity that closed the day.                  |
| closed_at         | Close timestamp.                                           |
| state_hash        | Deterministic hash of fact state used for reproducibility. |

## 8.3 Temporal rules

1\. Actual events are immutable after the day is closed; a correction creates a compensating event with a link to the original event.

2\. A future plan record may be replaced only by publishing a newer plan version; historical versions remain queryable.

3\. A scenario is evaluated against a specific baseline plan version. If the baseline changes, the scenario becomes STALE and must be rebased.

4\. No scenario may mutate actual facts.

5\. All forecast values carry source, confidence, model version and calculation timestamp.

6\. The system stores both effective_date and recorded_at so historical reconstruction is possible.

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Production Order       | Created/released/confirmed/cancelled actual events | Future release, priority, dates, resource allocation              | Scenario stores override/event delta; actual events remain global facts  |
| Work Center / Resource | Closed-day availability and actual downtime        | Future capacity calendar, maintenance windows, efficiency factors | Scenario overlays future capacity only                                   |
| Material               | Historical stock/consumption/receipts              | Expected receipts, reservations, projected balance                | Scenario may change future receipts/allocations                          |
| Cash                   | Posted/closed financial facts                      | Forecast cash availability and approved injections                | Scenario may inject or defer future funding assumptions                  |
| Commitment             | Confirmed historical milestone facts               | Forecast completion and due-date risk                             | Scenario may change priority/due-date assumptions according to authority |

| **IMPLEMENTATION RULE:** A scenario engine must never clone actual history into mutable rows. It references the immutable actual timeline and overlays only future deltas. This is the technical mechanism that guarantees that Scenario A cannot accidentally change the historical truth shared with Scenario B or the baseline plan. |

# 12. Dynamic Daily Planning Engine

## 12.1 Engine responsibility

The Daily Planning Engine converts fact-anchored state plus known future events into a deterministic, daily-bucketed future plan. It must be incremental where possible: a localized resource change recalculates only affected products/orders/resources first, followed by a portfolio reconciliation pass when cross-case competition can change.

## 12.2 State transition

Figure 12-1 — Daily planning pseudo-code

For planning day D:

FactState(D) = all immutable actuals through D

FutureEvents(D+1..H) = approved future events

BasePlan(D+1..H) = previous baseline version or new generation

NextPlan = Replan(FactState, FutureEvents, MasterDataSnapshot, RulesVersion)

For each day t in D+1..H:

capacity\[t\] = calendar(t) - maintenance(t) - confirmed_losses(t)

supply\[t\] = on_hand(t-1) + receipts(t) - allocations(t)

demand\[t\] = explosion(BOM, routing, scheduled_operations)

constraints\[t\] = capacity\[t\], supply\[t\], manpower\[t\], cash\[t\], precedence\[t\]

schedule\[t\] = feasible_allocation(constraints\[t\], priorities, commitments)

state\[t\] = state\[t-1\] + receipts - consumption + execution_events

## 12.3 Daily planning algorithm

1\. Load immutable actuals up to planning cut-off.

2\. Load the latest approved baseline version.

3\. Load master-data snapshot and rule-set version effective for the horizon.

4\. Apply future confirmed events: receipts, maintenance, planned capacity, approved commitments and other hard constraints.

5\. Apply flexible decision variables from the baseline plan.

6\. Build remaining production workload from open production orders and operations.

7\. Time-phase material, capacity, manpower and cash requirements.

8\. Run constraint propagation from resource shortage to operation, order, product and commitment.

9\. Generate candidate reallocations or schedule changes within configured search limits.

10\. Calculate a feasible baseline; if infeasible, create a crisis record identifying the blocking set.

11\. Persist a complete plan version with calculation metadata and hashes.

12\. Publish resource requirement and risk read models to the UI.

## 12.4 Incremental recalculation rules

| **Change**                  | **Minimum recalculation scope**                                                 | **Escalation rule**                                              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| One machine breakdown       | All operations assigned/eligible to machine; affected products and commitments  | Expand to competing work centers if reallocation occurs.         |
| One material receipt delay  | All future demand lines for material; downstream orders                         | Expand to products/commitments with critical dates.              |
| One product priority change | All resources competing with product; impacted products sharing those resources | Expand to entire portfolio if optimization is enabled.           |
| Cash injection              | Procurement/finance-blocked future actions within horizon                       | Expand if resource release changes machine/material competition. |
| New production order        | Order plus competing resource/material pools                                    | Portfolio reconciliation if it displaces existing work.          |
| Quality hold                | Held item and all dependent/consuming operations                                | Expand through parent product and commitment graph.              |

## 13.3 Scenario result requirements

- Commitment impact by product and due date.

- Resource loading by day.

- Material projected balance and first shortage day.

- Manpower demand and overtime need.

- Cash requirement by day.

- Change in throughput/WIP.

- Opportunity cost on displaced products.

- Assumptions and confidence levels.

- Feasibility state and exact violated constraints.

- Comparison against selected baseline version.

# 14. Feasibility and Optimization Engine

## 14.1 Feasibility gate

Feasibility is a hard gate, not a score. An alternative is feasible only if all mandatory constraints are satisfied for every day of the scenario horizon. Soft constraints may be violated only when explicitly configured with a penalty and approval policy.

| **Constraint class**  | **Hard/soft**                    | **Example test**                                            |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Material availability | Hard by default                  | Projected available \>= required quantity on consuming day. |
| Capacity              | Hard by default                  | Allocated hours \<= available hours for work center/day.    |
| Operation precedence  | Hard                             | Start(op2) \>= finish(op1) + lead/transfer time.            |
| Calendar              | Hard                             | Operation uses working capacity only.                       |
| Quality block         | Hard                             | Held lot/product cannot be consumed/processed.              |
| Manpower skill        | Hard by default                  | Required skill count available on day.                      |
| Cash                  | Configurable                     | Cumulative cash requirement \<= approved available cash.    |
| Delivery due date     | Soft or hard by commitment class | Penalty if commitment class permits slippage.               |
| Strategic priority    | Objective/constraint             | Used through configured priority weight or threshold.       |

## 14.2 Optimization objective model

Objective = w1\*BusinessValue + w2\*OnTimeDelivery + w3\*CashEfficiency

\+ w4\*CapacityStability + w5\*RiskReduction

\- w6\*ResourceInjection - w7\*OpportunityCost - w8\*Penalty

Weights are configuration for the decision context, not embedded business truth.

The engine must output the complete weighted terms so management can see why alternatives differ.

## 14.3 No-solution behavior

If no feasible solution exists within configured search limits, the engine emits RESOURCE_CRISIS. The crisis record must list the minimum blocking constraints, affected commitments, earliest failure date and the classes of intervention capable of changing feasibility (capacity, material, manpower, cash, sequence, outsourcing, or commitment change).

## 14.3 Optimization variable model

The reference formulation is a time-bucketed mixed-integer/linear model. A production implementation may use OR-Tools, Gurobi, CPLEX or another approved solver; the API contract must remain solver-neutral.

Decision variables

-----------------

x\[o,r,t\] = 1 if operation o is assigned to resource r on day t

y\[o,t\] = executable quantity/hours of operation o on day t

z\[p,t\] = 1 if product/commitment p is completed by day t

i\[r,t\] = injected capacity/resource amount on day t

Core constraints

----------------

1\. Assignment: sum_r x\[o,r,t\] \<= 1

2\. Capacity: sum_o demand\[o,r,t\] \<= capacity\[r,t\] + i\[r,t\]

3\. Material balance: opening\[m,t\] + receipts\[m,t\] - demand\[m,t\] \>= safety\[m,t\]

4\. Precedence: start\[o+1\] \>= finish\[o\] for every routing predecessor

5\. Quantity: cumulative y\[o,t\] \<= required_quantity\[o\]

6\. Commitment: completion\[p\] \<= due_date\[p\] for on-time target cases

7\. Skill: assigned skill-hours \<= available certified skill-hours

8\. Cash: cumulative planned cash use \<= available cash + approved injection

9\. Frozen facts: no decision variable may modify closed-day actuals

Minimum-injection objective example

-----------------------------------

Minimize Sum(i\[r,t\] \* unit_cost\[r,t\])

subject to all hard constraints and configured on-time / quality targets.

Value objective example

------------------------

Maximize business_value(completions)

\- delay_penalties

\- injection_cost

\- opportunity_cost

The engine may support lexicographic objectives or weighted objectives, but the selected objective, weights and constraint set must be persisted in optimization_run and decision records.

## 14.4 Determinism and solver governance

- Persist solver name, solver version, model version, rule-set version, input state hash and random seed where applicable.

- For regulated/decision-critical runs, require deterministic mode and a maximum acceptable solver gap.

- If the solver terminates early, status must be FEASIBLE_BEST_FOUND, not OPTIMAL.

- Never present a mathematical optimum as a business-optimal decision unless all governed constraints and objective weights are included.

- A solver failure does not imply a feasible plan; return CALCULATION_FAILED and preserve the run evidence.

# 15. Resource Allocation and Opportunity-Cost Model

## 15.1 Resource types

| **Resource**        | **Examples**                         | **State dimension**          | **Typical constraint** |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------------|
| Machine/work center | CNC, VPI, winding, assembly/test     | available hours by day       | Capacity               |
| Material            | Copper, insulation, steel, mica tape | quantity by day/lot          | Stock and receipts     |
| Manpower            | Technician, welder, test engineer    | headcount/skill-hours by day | Skill capacity         |
| Cash                | Working capital, procurement budget  | available cash by day        | Funding                |
| Energy              | Power availability                   | hours/energy window by day   | Utility limit          |
| Supplier            | Supplier capacity/ETA                | promise date/quantity        | Lead time              |
| Quality capacity    | Inspection/test capability           | hours/slots by day           | Test bottleneck        |

## 15.2 Opportunity cost

When a scarce resource is allocated to Product A, the engine computes the marginal impact on Products B..N that could otherwise consume the same capacity. Opportunity cost is represented in operational units (days/hours), commercial units where governed data exists, and resource-injection alternatives. It is never hidden inside an aggregate score only.

OpportunityCost(resource R, scenario S) =

Sum(impact_on_displaced_commitments)

\+ Sum(additional_resource_requirements_for_displaced_work)

\+ penalties(configured for displaced commitments)

## 16.2 Day-close algorithm

1\. Stop acceptance of unapproved edits to the closing day.

2\. Reconcile SAP/MES confirmations and material movements received before cut-off.

3\. Persist immutable actual events.

4\. Compute closing KPIs and forecast error seeds.

5\. Generate the next open planning day.

6\. Recalculate baseline future plan from the frozen actual state.

7\. Re-evaluate risks and create/refresh cases.

8\. Notify affected planners/managers.

## 16.3 Daily state-transition pseudocode

return plan

# 17. Decision Governance and Approval Model

## 17.1 Decision authority levels

| **Level** | **Role archetype**                     | **Can do**                                                   | **Approval boundary**                           |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| L1        | Planner / Product Owner                | Create cases, run scenarios, quantify alternatives           | May commit within local threshold if authorized |
| L2        | Functional manager / portfolio manager | Review cross-product impact, select candidate for escalation | Approves functional resource reallocations      |
| L3        | Steering Committee / senior management | Approve high-impact commitment/resource changes              | Final for configured thresholds                 |
| L4        | System administrator                   | Technical config only                                        | No business approval                            |

## 17.2 Decision record

Every approved decision stores: decision_id, case_id, base_plan_version, alternatives considered, feasibility evidence, objective weights, selected alternative, approvers, timestamp, execution owner, expected outcomes and review date. The record is immutable; changes create a new decision version.

# 18. Lesson Learned and Organizational Learning

Lesson Learned is a first-class operational object. It is generated from forecast-vs-actual evidence and can influence future forecasts through explicit rule links. The MVP does not require opaque machine learning. Reusable patterns may begin as deterministic rules with evidence and confidence.

## 19.1 MDM lifecycle

DRAFT -\> VALIDATED -\> APPROVED -\> EFFECTIVE -\> SUPERSEDED -\> RETIRED

No planning calculation may use RETIRED or unapproved master records.

Every planning calculation stores the effective master-data snapshot/version used.

# 20. Database Design and Physical Schema

## 20.1 Data architecture

The transactional core uses PostgreSQL. Actual event tables and high-volume telemetry/event tables are append-only and partitioned by business date. Plan and scenario data are normalized enough for transactional correctness, with denormalized read models for dashboards. No analytical workload may block the planning transaction path.

## 20.2 Schemas

| **Schema**  | **Purpose**                                                       |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| core        | Identity-neutral business entities and master references.         |
| planning    | Plan versions, daily buckets, resource allocations and forecasts. |
| scenario    | Branches, events, calculated scenario results.                    |
| execution   | Actual events, confirmations and reconciliation.                  |
| integration | Inbox/outbox, mappings, message logs and quarantine.              |
| learning    | Lessons, patterns, calibration links.                             |
| audit       | Immutable audit entries.                                          |
| readmodel   | Denormalized query projections.                                   |
| config      | Rules, parameters, thresholds, calendars.                         |

## 20.4 Physical design rules

- Partition execution.actual_event by planning_day_id/business month once volume threshold is crossed.

- Partition audit.audit_event by month or quarter based on measured volume.

- Index all foreign keys used in joins.

- Use covering indexes only for proven read paths.

- Use JSONB for extensible payloads, never for core relational relationships.

- Use UUID for internal IDs and preserve SAP/external IDs in dedicated columns.

- Never hard-delete actual or audit rows.

- Archive closed plan versions after configurable retention while keeping hashes and summary read models online.

- Use VACUUM/ANALYZE automation and monitor bloat.

## 20.5 Canonical data types and mandatory constraints

| **Type**        | **Canonical representation** | **Mandatory constraint**                                                       |
|-----------------|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Internal ID     | UUID                         | Generated server-side; immutable                                               |
| External SAP ID | VARCHAR(80)                  | Unique within source system + object type                                      |
| Business date   | DATE                         | Always interpreted in plant planning timezone                                  |
| Timestamp       | TIMESTAMPTZ                  | Store offset-aware instant in UTC; render in plant/user timezone               |
| Quantity        | NUMERIC(20,6)                | Non-negative unless movement/event semantics explicitly permit signed quantity |
| Hours           | NUMERIC(16,3)                | Non-negative planned/actual durations                                          |
| Money           | NUMERIC(24,2)                | Currency code required; never mix currencies without explicit conversion       |
| Confidence      | ENUM-like VARCHAR(10)        | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW only                                                           |
| Status          | VARCHAR(30)                  | Controlled vocabulary per aggregate state machine                              |
| Hash            | VARCHAR(128)                 | SHA-256 or stronger approved digest of canonical serialized evidence           |

All core tables must have created_at/created_by and updated_at/updated_by where the row is mutable. Actual and audit rows additionally require source_system, source_id and immutable_hash. Soft deletion is permitted for master/configuration rows only when required by lifecycle; actual facts are never soft-deleted or rewritten.

# 21. API Architecture and Contracts

## 21.1 API conventions

- Base path: /api/v1.

- JSON over HTTPS; UTF-8; timestamps ISO-8601 with offset.

- Idempotency-Key required for POST commands.

- ETag / If-Match required for mutable aggregate updates.

- Every response contains request_id/correlation_id.

- Pagination is cursor-based for high-volume lists.

- Errors use RFC 7807 problem+json shape.

| **COMMAND SEMANTICS:** Commands create events or immutable decision records; they do not directly mutate a read model. The domain engine consumes the command, validates authority/effective date/version, persists the event transactionally, and asynchronously or synchronously (by SLA) creates the next plan version. |

# 22. SAP S/4HANA Integration Architecture

## 22.1 Integration principle

The preferred pattern is SAP released APIs for request/response, events/IDocs for asynchronous changes, and RFC only when a released API is not available and an integration architecture exception is approved. SAP Integration Suite/Cloud Integration may be used as the managed integration layer in hybrid deployments; SAP documentation confirms it supports cloud-to-on-premise and hybrid integration, and SAP Cloud Connector can provide controlled on-premise access without opening inbound ports. \[SRC-04\]\[SRC-05\]

## 22.3 Integration reliability pattern

SAP -\> Adapter -\> Inbox(idempotent) -\> Canonical Event -\> Domain Handler -\> Outbox -\> Read Models

Failures:

1\. Schema validation failure -\> QUARANTINE

2\. Temporary network failure -\> RETRY with exponential backoff

3\. Duplicate -\> ACK/no-op

4\. Business validation failure -\> REJECTED with remediation code

5\. Persistent failure -\> DEAD LETTER + alert

Never: distributed 2-phase commit between SAP and platform.

## 22.4 Security

- TLS 1.2+; prefer TLS 1.3 where supported.

- mTLS for system-to-system channels where supported.

- OAuth2/client credentials or SAP-supported technical user mechanism for APIs.

- Use SAP Cloud Connector for hybrid connectivity where applicable; no direct inbound exposure of SAP internal ports.

- Principal propagation only where end-user traceability is explicitly required and supported.

- Store certificates/secrets in enterprise vault, not Git or container images.

|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Daily planning        | Given frozen actuals and governed master snapshot, the engine produces a reproducible day-by-day future plan with documented resource constraints. |
| Scenario engine       | A scenario can be forked, changed, calculated, compared and discarded without altering the baseline.                                               |
| Material forecast     | The system identifies first shortage date and affected orders with traceable demand lines.                                                         |
| Resource feasibility  | Every selected alternative has a machine/material/manpower/cash feasibility explanation.                                                           |
| Optimization          | The engine produces one or more feasible alternatives and exposes objective terms and opportunity cost.                                            |
| Commitment trace      | A user can trace commitment -\> product -\> PO -\> operation -\> resource -\> event -\> impact.                                                    |
| Actual reconciliation | Closed-day actuals remain immutable and future plan is recalculated from them.                                                                     |

## 30.2 UX rules

- Progressive disclosure: executives see impact first; planners see causal detail on drill-down.

- Every red/amber status must be clickable to the underlying evidence.

- Past and future must have visually distinct states.

- Scenario changes must show BEFORE vs AFTER.

- Every scenario result must show the effective date of each assumption.

- Use Persian RTL and English localization from the same UI model; no hard-coded labels.

- No KPI without source timestamp and data freshness indicator.

|--------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| R01    | Internal SAP APIs/configuration differ from expected | High         | API discovery pack + release-specific contract test before build.   |
| R02    | Poor master-data quality                             | High         | Data-quality gate and quarantine; no planning on unresolved master. |

- Internal interfaces needed for MES/SCADA/Primavera can be supplied as governed contracts.

# 34. Architecture Decision Records

| **ADR** | **Decision**              | **Rationale**                                                                                                                                                       |
|---------|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ADR-001 | Daily planning bucket     | Use one working day as minimum planning quantum. Enables operational planning without sub-day simulation complexity; matches user-defined minimum effect principle. |
| ADR-002 | Temporal immutability     | Closed-day facts are immutable; corrections are compensating events. Preserves auditability and forecast-vs-actual learning.                                        |
| ADR-003 | Scenario branch model     | Scenario stores deltas against a baseline plan version. Avoids duplicated datasets and keeps comparisons explainable.                                               |
| ADR-004 | Modular monolith first    | Deploy one application boundary with internal modules before extracting services. Reduces distributed-system complexity while preserving bounded contexts.          |
| ADR-005 | On-premise first          | Core planning and data remain operational without internet. Supports plant continuity and local control.                                                            |
| ADR-006 | SAP integration boundary  | No direct SAP DB access; use released APIs/events/IDocs and approved RFC exceptions. Protects upgradeability and integrity.                                         |
| ADR-007 | Feasibility gate          | No infeasible alternative reaches final selection. Separates technical possibility from management preference.                                                      |
| ADR-008 | Explainable optimization  | Store objective terms, constraints, solver metadata and alternative deltas. Builds planner trust and enables audit.                                                 |
| ADR-009 | AI boundary               | AI cannot directly mutate baseline or SAP. Prevents uncontrolled automation in mission-critical planning.                                                           |
| ADR-010 | Learning as configuration | Initial lessons influence rules via explicit approved calibration links. Provides controlled learning before opaque ML.                                             |
